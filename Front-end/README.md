# Front-end

## Flutter

### Functionality :
- Let the Spot speak by typing input text which can select the output languages with the Robot sounds.
- Let the Spot speak by analyzing the user's voice.  *currently support in US-English only
- Let the user save text to the audio file to reserve the conversation on the cloud and could play through the Spot instantly.
- Fetching the Audio file and content in the file from the cloud shows in the apps which provide the preview such as the statement, languages, name of the file and also the user can preview audio file on their devices in real-time before sending to the Spot to speaks.

### Advantage of Flutter :
- Can export and install cross-platform which including iOS devices, Android devices, and Web Apps in the same code.
- Don't need to use multiple languages such as Kotlin, Swift, HTML or React.js to implement all of these platforms. 
- Even it takes time to study a new language, but it reduces the redundancy of code and saves time to using specific languages to install on each platform.

### Disavantage of Flutter :
- New Platform which take a time to study and implement with the new syntax and rules.
- For Dart Languages, not a lot of people using it at present.
- The constraint of the languages.
