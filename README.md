## Backgrounds :


## Motivations :
- After I know how to operate and access to control the Spot CAM (PTZ), I'm looking for a more beautiful User Interface and more powerful functionality. I desired to research the speaker on the Spot CAM for using the speaker in terms of factory field to notify or respond to the user, in case of emergency such as the unusual circumstance like the spot detected the gas leak or respond the voice command from the apps such as the battery status or conversation with the user like Siri, Alexa or Google Assistant to earn better experience more than using controller by using voice command from the apps to control the Spot, more mobility and easy to command.

## Objectives :
- Learn how to operate speaker on Spot CAM (PTZ).
- Learn how to generate the custom audio file which the Spot CAM speaker supported.
- Learn how to load the custom audio file into the speaker.
- Learn how to integrate the Python API with the Flutter UI.
- Learn how to integrate the Python API with Firebase to store the audio files and the information of the audio files.
